# Unify_Wallet_FX

This is the Unify Wallet JavaFX Application created By Team 2.

All functionalities have been tested and work properly.

Due to the issues with Oracle not updating javaFX and both intellij and eclipse losing 
support to produce 100% working artifacts here is how to get our Unify_Wallet_FX.jar to work.

1. Download the code in the .zip file from the releases tab in GitHub.
2. Once downloaded and extracted then open the project in intellij
3. once the project has been opend then configure your project settings to run the project on java 1.8 (specifically corretto 1.8.0_312).
4. Next you want to go to the top right where the configurations are and add a configuration for a jar application, and select the 
jre to be the same as the JDK above and select the artifact from the out folder.
5. Once that is done in the top of the ide select build and press build artifact.
6. Now you can close the project and open your file explorer and go to the project folder you downloaded and open the out folder and make your way to the artifact.
7. now you can double click on the Unify_Wallet_FX.jar (executable) and it will run. 

****Note****
If the file wont open it is bacause you do not have java runtime installed on your pc or mac please go to the website and download and intall java runtime.
If that does not work then it is due to the insufficient support from Oracle for not keeping their software up to date.
